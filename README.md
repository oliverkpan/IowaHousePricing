# IowaHousePricing

### About
In machine learning, there are various types of supervised learning. The focus of this project is regression, in which we will look to predict house prices in Iowa. This project is inspired by the Kaggle competition below; I will use advanced regression techniques to lower the error as much as possible and predict with the highest accuracy. This competition is judged by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), but I use various metrics for evaluation. 

### Current Progress
Currently, there have been various models created, with small fractions of the data. The next implementation will be using various gradient boosters and further analysis of the garage and basement dataframes.

### Models Used
[Linear Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)

[Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html)

[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/about.html)


### Next Steps
I am hoping to strengthen my documentation and statistical understanding of regression. Here are the steps that I am taking in this project to ensure success.

1. Explore and create visualizations to further understand the data
2. Break the columns into smaller parts and analyse feature importance using various Regression models
3. Try and test new libraries, since this project has a strong learning component. (I would like to learn new technologies)
4. Engineer some features to push for lower RMSE and higher accuracy
5. Use various metrics to understand the model
6. Submit predictions to Kaggle
7. Deploy model in a way that is useable with a build front-end
