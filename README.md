# IowaHousePricing

### About
In machine learning, there are various types of supervised learning. The focus of this project is regression, in which we will look to predict house prices in Iowa. This project is inspired by the Kaggle competition below; I will use advanced regression techniques to lower the error as much as possible and predict with the highest accuracy. This competition is judged by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), but I use various metrics for evaluation. 

### Current Progress
Currently, there have been various models created, with small fractions of the data. The next implementation will be using various gradient boosters and further analysis of the garage and basement dataframes.

### Models Used
I hope to use various types of regression models to assist with this competition. For instance, I will be implementing Random Forest and XGBoost.

### Learning Outcomes
I am hoping to strengthen my documentation and statistical understanding of regression. I hope to deploy the final model and create an interface.
