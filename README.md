# IowaHousePricing


### About
This project aims to analyse the housing prices in Iowa. I will use the models to predict other house prices, given features and variables.

### Models Used
I hope to use various types of regression models to assist with this competition. For instance, I will be implementing Random Forest and XGBoost.

### Learning Outcomes
I am hoping to strengthen my documentation and statistical understanding of regression.
